Making dummy variables
```{r}
load('dat1.RData')
```


```{r}
design_matrix = 
  dat1 |>
  mutate(
    race_asian = as.numeric(race == 2),
    race_black = as.numeric(race == 3),
    race_hispanic = as.numeric(race == 4),
    smoking_former = as.numeric(smoking == 1),
    smoking_current = as.numeric(smoking ==2)
  ) %>% 
  select(
    age, gender, race_asian, race_black, race_hispanic, 
    smoking_former, smoking_current, height, weight,
    bmi, diabetes, hypertension, SBP, LDL, time,
